> Bitcoin indie game for Repl.it Contest

## Gameplay

> Its best you play the game on a desktop; mobile isn't designed yet. And is only fully compatible with Chromium based browsers

Control the bitcoin using the left `<|` & right `|>` arrow keys. Try your best to dodge Bitcoin's FUD bars and increase your high score.

> Note: +1 Points are also randomly awarded for your survival (how long you have avoided the bars).<br><br>The FUD contained in each FUD bar is randomly generated and placed at the top left of th screen, this way you know what FUD is in the bars.

As the FUD bars increase their speed as they approach you can slow them down by pressing a randomly chosen `key` (shown at the top right).
